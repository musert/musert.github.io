## Research Focus

The primary objective of Dr. Sert's research is to develop advanced methods for processing and interpreting multimedia data, with a particular emphasis on audio-visual interactions and multimodal content analysis in the context of **semantic multimedia**.

We study the integration of multiple modalities—such as **text**, **audio**, and **video**—within multimedia content to enhance the understanding and processing of information. Leveraging **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques, our research aims to improve how machines interpret and respond to multimodal data, ultimately enhancing **human-computer interaction** and **content accessibility**.

## Bio

Mustafa Sert is currently a Senior Research Scholar in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the University of California, Irvine, while also holding the position of Associate Professor of Computer Engineering in the Department of Computer Engineering at Başkent University. His research and teaching interests lie in the areas of **audio signal processing**, **machine learning**, **semantic multimedia**, and **software engineering (SWE)**. In particular, his expertise includes **deep learning**, **language-based audio analysis**, **speech processing**, **acoustic pattern recognition**, **audio-video content understanding**, and **multimodal analysis** ([research](https://www.baskent.edu.tr/~msert/research.html)).

Mustafa Sert is currently the Vice Dean of the Faculty of Engineering at Başkent University. He has been an administrative board member of the **Distance Education Center (BUZEM)** since 2011 and a board member of the **Faculty of Engineering** since 2021. He previously served as the **Vice-Chairman of the Department of Computer Engineering (2008–2012)**, a faculty administrative board member of the **Faculty of Engineering (2008–2021)**, and as a board member of **Kazan Vocational School (2018–2022)** and **Anadolu O.S.B.
